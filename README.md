Question:
> Write a code that calculates the Modular multiplicative inverse of a number using the Euclidean Algorithm?

# Theory
The modular multiplicative inverse of an integer a is an integer x such that the product ax is congruent to 1 with respect to the modulus m.[1] In the standard notation of modular arithmetic this congruence is written as

{\displaystyle ax\equiv 1{\pmod {m}},}ax \equiv 1 \pmod{m}, (Source: Wikipedia)
